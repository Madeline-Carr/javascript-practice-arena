//Multi-Dimensional Arrays

//A Multi-Dimensional Array is an array with arrays inside of it. 

//How can I make a Multi-Dimensional Arrays?
let myMultiDimenArray = [[1, 2, 3, 4], ["a", "b", "c", "d"]];

//

// Setup
let myArray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
let myData = myArray[2][1];

//The first number selects the array in myArray. 
//So it gives you [7,8,9]
//Then the second number is the element in that array.
//So it gives you 8
