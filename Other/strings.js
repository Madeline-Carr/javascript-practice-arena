//Escaping Characters

// You can escape characters with a backslash \
//So to make a string that types a backslash you could do this.
let backslash = "\\";
console.log(backslash);
//This prints one backslash.

//OTHERS
// To make a quote you can type \"
// or \' 
// To make an indent you can type \t
// To make a new line you can type \n

let example = "\tThis is indented\n now there is a new line!\n\"I am a quote!\"";
console.log(example);
